# Compiler Construction (coco)

A Template for the Compiler Construction course at the HEIA-FR



## Customization

The file `.install.sh` is executed when the container is built. You can modify this file to install additional tools or libraries.

Currently, this script configure the theme for [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and patches the `~/.zshrc` file to source the `.zshrc` file from the project folder.
